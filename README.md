# chorus-effect-tutorial
This is a simple notebook to teach you how to implement a chorus effect. You can use this code as base to experiment with your own ideas. 

To run the notebook you need to install the dependencies in “requirements.txt” as: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When loading a new project in python, it is always a good practice to create a virtual environment just for the project and install things on it, so you avoid possible dependency conflicts between your libraries (I promise you, this will happen eventually if you use only one environment). This can be done in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) using the following commands:
```
conda create --name chorus-effect-tutorial python=3.10
conda activate chorus-effect-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
